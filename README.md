# Hi there, hello!

## General
I'm ZoÃ«, i (obviously) love programming.
I love the concept of open-source software which i will make aswell, someday.
Modularity is also my one of my favorite concepts. You'll rarely see me make something hard coded (unless it's a quick prototype).

## Languages
JavaScript(Node.JS) is currently my primairy language which i'm using for various discord bots.
But other than that i also use python for some automated tasks and C++ for microcontroller related projects.

My programming skills are far from professional, but i'm also not a noobie.
Don't laugh when you see some of my earlier projects :sob:
